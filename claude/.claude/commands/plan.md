# Plan

Think hard about this task before writing any code: $ARGUMENTS

1. Research the codebase to understand:
   - Existing patterns and conventions
   - Related functionality
   - Potential impacts

2. Create a detailed plan covering:
   - Files to create/modify
   - Key implementation decisions
   - Edge cases to handle
   - Testing strategy

3. Write the plan to `plan.md` in the current directory

4. Wait for my approval before implementing

Do NOT write any implementation code until I confirm the plan.
